Webcam Website Widget
=====================

Webcam Website Widget 0.1

Webcam uploads jpg images to a folder in a linux server (./upload). After that, image_webcam.sh is processing that images, and using convert_webcam.php, adds watermark and timestamp.

Using Javascript, it shows images as a slideshow, using "cache" and more real effect. In this way, it avoids people who visit webpage and don't close the browser.

launch_script.sh deletes old files and launchs the full process, even after a reboot.
